### Overview
MarketJS is a small application that is meant to be used as a proof-of-concept about some technologies that i wanted to dig into.

### Stack

I'm currently using:
- nodejs
- Typescript
- React
- nextjs
- styled-components
- React Context
- React Hooks
- Jest
- Enzyme

### Running the application
```bash
npm start
```

### Running the tests locally
```bash
npm run test
```

### TODOs

- add tests
- add an in-memory database for local testing and a relational database for production environments
- onboard the application into heroku
- add end-to-end tests (cypress)
- add more complex typescript typing 
- add badges
- add a continuous delivery service (probably travisci)
- the UX sucks (I know right!), I'll think a better one
- add more ecommerce functionality like a cart of popups to simulate a "view more"

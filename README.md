# Market JS

[![tested with jest](https://img.shields.io/badge/tested_with-jest-99424f.svg)](https://github.com/facebook/jest)

### Overview

MarketJS is a small application that is meant to be used as a proof-of-concept about some technologies that i wanted to dig into.

### Stack

I'm currently using:

- nodejs
- Typescript
- React
- nextjs
- emotion
- emotion/styles
- React Context
- React Hooks
- Jest
- React Testing Tools (coming soon)

### Running the application

```bash
npm start
```

### Running the tests locally

```bash
npm run test
```

### TODOs

- add tests (in progress!)
- add an in-memory database for local testing and a relational database for production environments
- onboard the application into heroku
- add end-to-end tests (cypress)
- add more complex typescript typing
- ~~add badges~~
- ~~add a continuous delivery service (probably travisci)~~
- the UX sucks (I know!), I'll think a better one
- add more ecommerce functionality like a cart or popups to simulate a "view more".
- add create a docker image & add k8s support
